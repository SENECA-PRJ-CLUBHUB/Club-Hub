# Sprint 1 Reflection

* Nishit (Team Leader):

    1. Create an intuitive navigation bar (#1).

    2. Display upcoming events on the welcome page (#5).

* Priyansh (me):

    1. Implement sign-in functionality (#2).
 
    2. Mock Data (#6).

* Yash:

    1. Implement the registration process (#3).

* Yuvraj:

    1. Integrate sign-in/register with the authentication system (#4).

The initial layout was completed successfully, and the files were uploaded to GitHub, allowing the rest of the team to build on that work. However, we encountered some issues during the subsequent phases:

* Yash's Contribution: Yash faced difficulties uploading his code to GitHub and sent it to Priyansh via chat. Upon review, Priyansh found his code incompatible with our site layout, and it was not functioning correctly.

* Yuvraj's Contribution: Yuvraj uploaded a JavaScript file (authservice.js) for authentication prematurely. Unfortunately, this file was not functioning correctly and required significant revisions.

To ensure the project stayed on track, Priyansh and I discussed the issues and took the initiative to complete Priyansh's assigned tasks, as well as rectify and integrate Yash and Yuvraj's contributions. Additionally, Priyansh added mock data to our MongoDB database. I provided assistance with the mock data and the authentication process. A detailed explanation of task changes is updated in the Sprint 1 issues. Despite these challenges, Priyansh and I managed to successfully complete all the tasks for Sprint 1.
